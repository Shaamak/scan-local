Common Services Running on Detected Open Ports
Port 22/tcp (SSH)
Service: Secure Shell (SSH)

Purpose: Provides encrypted remote login and command execution between computers over a network. Commonly used by system administrators for secure remote management of servers and devices.

Port 80/tcp (HTTP)
Service: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

Purpose: Used for unencrypted web traffic; delivers web pages from a server to a browser. It is the standard port for web servers hosting websites.

Port 443/tcp (HTTPS)
Service: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

Purpose: Used for encrypted web traffic; ensures secure communication between web browsers and servers using SSL/TLS certificates. It is the standard for secure websites.


Potential Security Risks from Open Ports
Port 22/tcp (SSH)
Risks:

Susceptible to brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used.

If exposed to the internet, attackers may attempt unauthorized access.

Outdated SSH software can have vulnerabilities.

Mitigations:

Use strong, unique passwords or SSH keys.

Restrict access to trusted IP addresses.

Keep SSH software updated.

Consider changing the default port or using additional protections like fail2ban.

Port 80/tcp (HTTP)
Risks:

Transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception and eavesdropping.

Exposed web servers can be targeted for attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web vulnerabilities.

May reveal sensitive information about the server or application if not properly configured.

Mitigations:

Redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Regularly update and patch web server software.

Use web application firewalls and secure coding practices.

Port 443/tcp (HTTPS)
Risks:

While encrypted, vulnerabilities can exist if SSL/TLS configurations are weak or outdated.

Misconfigured certificates or weak ciphers can be exploited.

Web applications behind HTTPS are still susceptible to attacks like XSS or SQL injection if not properly secured.

Mitigations:

Use strong, up-to-date SSL/TLS configurations.

Regularly renew and validate certificates.

Keep web applications and servers patched.
